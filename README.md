### Assignment B3 - Shiny App 

This is the repository for modifications made to Dean Attali's [Shiny App demo](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/). The app contains an interactive table and graph that shows [data](https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server/tree/master/bcl/data) about products sold by BC Liquor.  

It includes 

 * a graph,
 
 * a table, 
 
 * and filters for both, which allows you to select price ranges, country of origin, and type of alcohol. 

Changes I made to his original app include: 

 * adding a theme to make it look pretty, 
 
 * adding an "all" option to the country drop down,
 
 * and making the radio buttons into check boxes for the alcohol type.
